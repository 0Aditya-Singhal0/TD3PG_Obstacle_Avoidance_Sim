# TD3PG_Obstacle_Avoidance_Sim
This repository contains code for TD3PG and a self made matplotlib environment to test and simulate Deep Reinforcement Learning Models
The rectangle bot does not work fully with the environment feedback function yet. That will be addressed in future updates to the environment.

You can use my implementation of the environment as a template how the environment has been used.
For any other feedback, use the issues section. Cheers!
